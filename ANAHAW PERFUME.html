<h1>ANAHAW PERFUME</h1>
<ul>
<li>The sweet scent that flows from the leaves
of the dried anahaw
placed on the beams of small huts
as roofing
reveals the preciousness of age
that gives off a sweet smell
as it grows older and brittle.)

As it comes drifting to my nose,
I am thrown back to years ago
when I was but a little child
at play.

Should I continue this poem?
The bells are ringing…
Well, anyway, the scent of dried
anahaw leaves
gives me the feeling of knowing
better now that I have
advanced in age…

Back when I owned my time
and I was yet young, I
give off not a sweet smell.

Now that I am a bit older, I
know I’ve given off more…
