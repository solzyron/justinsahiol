<ul>
<li>Bamboo is a clean, green fragrance.  It is a favorite for guests wanting a green leafy smell.  It has a little citrus hint of lime with a bit of a cucumber finish. The natural, subtle character of this fragrance is calming rather than overwhelming, it works great with aromatherapy type blends - where a room filling, not house filling fragrance is what you are looking for.   This is one of our more popular fragrances because it blends well with so many different fragrance types.  I like this especially for bathroom mists, and candles.  It does a good job covering up unwanted smells in a clean outdoorsy way.  Don't be afraid of this one blending with most things.  I don't love it with baked good and pastry type fragrances but just about anything else works great!
